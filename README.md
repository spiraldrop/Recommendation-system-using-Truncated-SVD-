# Recommendation-system-using-Truncated-SVD

### About this project

This project touches the surface of how basic recommendation systems work with singular value decomposition (SVD) and the SGD algorithm. 

There are a total of two tasks, but the first one explains the working of the algorithm in much more pedantic detail. In this task, we predict the rating for a given (user_id, movie_id) pair by finding  ùë¶ÃÇ ùëñùëó. It can be calculated by solving the below equation:

where we find the best values of bi and cj by solving the below optimization problem:

We start by applying SVD decomposition on an Adjacency matrix which is just a sparse representation of user ratings on movies. Further instructions have been mentioned in the documentation part of the notebook.
